# Statistics-Module
A module for running basic calculations in statistics.
This project was suppposed to be a challenge but I had an idea to just complete the whole thing relating to the statistical aspect of calculations. This module is going to contain functions that will be able to do all the calculations relating to data analysis. It promises to be a very easy-to-use module.
The functions that will this module will be able to perform includes: Calculating the mean, median, mode, mean deviation, standard deviation of a given set of data.
This module will be updated frequently as the need arises.
Enjoy!
